# Labs at OOP

## Lab 0

Introduction lab, on installing a `UNIX-like` operating system, getting to know `git`, `Makefile`.

## Lab 1

This lab is based around remembering the `Data Structures` concept. There are two ways to complete
the lab, either the old-fashioned way to implement a menu with menu and tasks, or build a game in
terminal. I have selected to build a game, named `Puzzle 15`.
