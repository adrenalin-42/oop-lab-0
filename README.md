# Labs at OOP

## Lab 0

Introduction lab, on installing a `UNIX-like` operating system, getting to know `git`, `Makefile`.

## Lab 1

This lab is based around remembering the `Data Structures` concept. There are two ways to complete
the lab, either the old-fashioned way to implement a menu with menu and tasks, or build a game in
terminal. I have selected to build a game, named `Puzzle 15`.

## Lab 2

In this lab I started experimenting around with `Kotlin`, digging into Object Oriented Programming.
I started making a `Discord Chat Simulator`, by using the `Encapsulation` principle. There is even
a little simulation of that.

## Lab 3

In this lab I had to rewrite `Lab 2`, into using inheritance. A lot of code was gone and even more
was added.

## Lab 4

In this lab I had to rewrite `Lab 3`, into using polymorphism. It was fun. (not really :sadkek:)
